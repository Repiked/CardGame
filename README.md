# CardGame
a project to make a card game between a computer and a person

The card game is to emulate a game that uses regular cards. Instead of using A, K, and Q it uses 14, 13, and 12. Each person is given 13 cards and for each turn plays a card.
The higher number beats the lower number. There is one exception though, which is when 2 beats 14. I added this mechanic so 14 is not overpowered.
The higher number gets tossed away in the trash pile while the lower number is given to the winner. Then if there are enough cards in the draw pile, the winner takes one card.
If the round is tied, the cards will get thrown away. (I'm going to add a mechanic soon so it'll be like a sudden death round with winner takes all)
The person that is the last person standing wins.

By the way, there are three different bot types. The 1st one plays randomly, the second one always plays the lowest card, while the last one always plays the highest card. 
When using the program, put 1 for the 1st, 2 for the 2nd, and 3 for the 3rd.
